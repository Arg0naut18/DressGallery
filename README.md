Upon the request of my beloved girlfriend Kiwi, this work is dedicated to her to categorize and keep track of all her clothes.

- A <strong>React</strong> based UI to cater seemless experience to browse through and categorize the endless collections of dresses.
- A <strong>FastApi</strong> based backend API to facilitate the storage of dresses.
- A <strong>MongoDB</strong> database in the backend to keep track of all the dresses and scale to limitless clothes.
